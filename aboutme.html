				<h2>Why I made this website</h2>
				<p>Partly, I made this website because I wanted to review metal music. But mainly, I needed to make a website for my digital technology assessment and I wanted to do something other than make an ad for my school. This felt natural to me, because it gave me plenty of freedom to think for myself nad incorporate cool ideas, while still having a defined scope of what I needed to work on. After all, you can do a lot of cool stuff with websites, but you can do a lot less when you only have 4/5 weeks to do it. But hey: metal is fun! So maybe I'll keep this website going anyway so that I have something to add to now and then. My future plans for this website include having multi-page review layouts, intergrating a database to it with all of the reviews- to make it easier to add new ones- and I might even expand to have more than just music reviews. Current events in the metal community, informational stuff on the history of metal and more are all up my alley and if can find the time and the will to add them, I will. That's Eli, signing off for now until the next block of text... right over there! --&#62;</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hey, I'm Eli. I play guitar in a band called Angels among Heretics, and do everything in a countless number of unfinished solo projects. Music in general has been a massive part of  my life since I was as young as 5, and though I started off on pop music and progressed to various forms of house and dubstep, metal has always been interesting to me. However, I didn't really know where to start- when I was introduced to System of a Down, all of that changed. Since then, I've gotten into all sorts of bands in all sorts of areas: Nu-Metal, Thrash, Groove and Core mainly. But really, my love is for metal in general, and everything around. Hence, I've chosen to review metal music so everyone else can hear about how much I love it. I also hope tobe able to do other things: So much of- well, really everything these days is completely oversaturated with attempts to increase watch time and fill people in on stuff they already know. I plan to try and fill that niche- possibly via this website- by creating a platform where every word the writer uses makes the post better.</p>

				<h2>FAQs</h2>
				<p>WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE SONG?
				In my eyes, the best song ever written is Sun//Eater by Lorna Shore. I'm yet to fault anything about it, and the raw emotion and intensity is insane. Not tomention- super innovative.
				
				WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE BAND?
				One of the first core bands I ever listened to was Northlane, and they still stand out as amazing to me- especially their "Hollow Existence" EP. That said, their later works (notably Alien) also standout as amazing- though their new, djent-y music doesn't hit the same for me.
				
				WHAT GUITAR DO YOU USE?
				I use an Aria Pro MkII 714. First guitar I ever got, basically the cheapest black one I could find, but it works decent for high-gain now the action is set. I also have an Artist Telecaster I use on occasion, and I'm working on modding an Ibanez SG from yonks ago that I picked up on TradeMe.</p>
