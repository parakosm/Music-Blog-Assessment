				<h2>Why I made this website</h2>
				<p>Partly, I made this website because I wanted to review metal music. But mainly, I needed to make a website for my digital technology assessment and I wanted to do something other than make an ad for my school. This felt natural to me, because it gave me plenty of freedom to think for myself nad incorporate cool ideas, while still having a defined scope of what I needed to work on. After all, you can do a lot of cool stuff with websites, but you can do a lot less when you only have 4/5 weeks to do it. But hey: metal is fun! So maybe I'll keep this website going anyway so that I have something to add to now and then. My future plans for this website include having multi-page review layouts, intergrating a database to it with all of the reviews- to make it easier to add new ones- and I might even expand to have more than just music reviews. Current events in the metal community, informational stuff on the history of metal and more are all up my alley and if can find the time and the will to add them, I will. That's Eli, signing off for now until the next block of text... right over there! --&#62;</p>
