			<h1>Northlane- Plenty</h1>
			<p>
				Northlane's Plenty is a true masterwork of modern metalcore. Despite it's utilisation of Drop D#, the melodies are still clearly and where other bands would have let their riff devolve into Djenty chaos, Northlane manage to provide an incredibly technical guitar riff that feels deeply emotional and catchy. Despite that, plenty never feels like a pop song. Indeed, it's choice to rely mainly on clean singing might trigger the gatekeepers among us to accuse it being "not metal enough", but Marcus Bridge's choice include occasional screams really makes the song for me. The contrast between the two really allows Bridge's pained lyrics to shine.

				On that subject, the lyrics paint a picture similar to that of Alice in Chains' Nutshell- that of a man who has already given up on life. The repetition of "If I'm asked to start again", and Bridge's answers to his own rhetoricals, convey a hint of the fact that Bridge possesses the trauma he touched on in such delicacy in Northlane's earlier Alien.
