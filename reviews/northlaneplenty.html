			<!-- Actual Review: just below title -->
			<p>
				Though I may not have chosen to review this song myself (refer to my <a href="abrbintro.html">review of Intro</a>), this song definiterly holds a special place in my heart. This song was in my top 15 most played last year, and Northlane themsleves have been my most listened band 2 years running. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Northlane's Plenty is a true masterwork of modern metalcore. Despite it's utilisation of Drop D#, the melodies are still clearly and where other bands would have let their riff devolve into Djenty chaos, Northlane manage to provide an incredibly technical guitar riff that feels deeply emotional and catchy. Despite that, plenty never feels like a pop song. Indeed, it's choice to rely mainly on clean singing might trigger the gatekeepers among us to accuse it being "not metal enough", but Marcus Bridge's choice include occasional screams makes the song for me. The contrast between the two really allows Bridge's pained lyrics to shine.
			</p>
			<p>
				On that subject, the lyrics paint a picture similar to that of Alice in Chains' Nutshell- that of a man who has already given up on life. The repetition of "If I'm asked to start again", and Bridge's answers to his own rhetoricals, convey a hint of the fact that Bridge possesses the trauma he touched on in such delicacy in Northlane's earlier Alien. Similarly, the spare nature of the verses allows these vocals to shine through in a very genuine way, and makes the chorus all the more impactful.
			</p>
			<p>
				Speaking of which: The Chorus. If you're not familiar with Northlane- understandably- their vocalist, Marcus Bridge, produces all of the music himself, refined and mixed by Adam "Nolly" Getgood. These two lads really outdid themsleves for Plenty, not only using layers expertly and without getting in the way of the song, but the one that really gets me is the little synth lead that plays a lick in the chorus. As someone who hasn't listened to plenty, this might nnot be of any note to you, but let me tell you now: it should be. I could rant for hours and hour upon end and never do justice the true glory of it. 7 notes, only 5 unique ones, but the sheer emotion it conjures up within the context of the song is absolutely wizard.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pun entirely intended, by the way.
