			<h1>Chevelle- Peach</h1>
			<p>
				So I first found this song after it ranked in the top 100- I think even the top 50- of NZ's top 2000 voted rock songs. All of the songs on there were great, but something about Peach stood out to me as particularly good. I'm entrely sure why, but I'll do my best to explain it.
			</p>
			<p>
				The logical place to start is the intro. It centers around what is, for the most part, a generic attempt at a sci-fi riff. They did do some smart things fading it in with a compressor, but for the most part, it's just uninspiring and ordering on boring and unlistenable. But I've just basically been insulting this song, yet I really like it? Well, the good part begins right after. The song cuts to a simple monotone riff, which would normally be a low-effort Meshuggah clone, except that the rhythm is well crafted and very thought out. The choice to make it this sparse was very effective.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the vocals enter, something very special happens. Their rushed, urgent delivery does justice to the tone of the song and to it's well-crafted lyrics. When the drums enter and the vocals become almost operatic, the atmosphere changes, and the skill expressed in the vocals is highlighted. The song then switches to a monotone version of the chorus, sans vocals. Note, by the way, that the guitar has been playing the same note since the intro. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Thankfully, when the second verse kicks in, it quickly begins playing a palm-muted version of the chorus- yay! Notes in the guitar. However, this is where much of the genius of the song comes from. Looking at the song, it's a simple minor I5-VI5-IV5 progression, but something about it works very well. I'm note even going to remotely try to describe the vibe it gives, but it just works. It's incredibly simple, but I can't fault  it in any way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, the chorus. By far the best part of the song, the riff that was teased in the verse finally kicks in to full swing. It hits like a truck thanks to the choice to use Drop C tuning, and the incorporation of occasional screamed vocals really adds something to it, and the octave lead is neat too. Finally, the solo is nothing special- it screams "I'm using bends as a crutch"- but it fits the song well. In the end, I only have a few words:
			</p>
			<p>
				"Well done, Chevelle."
