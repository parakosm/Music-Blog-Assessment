			<h1>Chevelle- Peach</h1>
			<p>
				So I first found this song after it ranked in the top 100- I think even the top 50- of NZ's top 2000 voted rock songs. All of the songs on there were great, but something about Peach stood out to me as particularly good. I'm entrely sure why, but I'll do my best to explain it.

				The logical place to start is the intro. It centers around what is, for the most part, a generic attempt at a sci-fi riff. They did do some smart things fading it in with a compressor, but for the most part, it's just uninspiring and ordering on boring and unlistenable. But I've just basically been insulting this song, yet I really like it? Well, the good part begins right after. The song cuts to a simple monotone riff, which would normally be a low-effort Meshuggah clone, except that the rhythm is well crafted and very thought out. The choice to make it this sparse was very effective.

				When the vocals enter, something very special happens. Their rushed, urgent delivery does justice to the tone of the song
