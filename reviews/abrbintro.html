				You might wonder what posessed me to review a song that comes in under one minute. To be honest, that's a very good question, and the answer is "A friend told me to." Granted, I suppose I sitll bear some of the responsibility given that I picked the songs by scrolling at massive speeds through my spotify playlist and getting my friends to point to songs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				That said, I take no issue with having to review this song. It definitely punches well above it's weight class, doing a great job of introducing the ABloRB sound to a new listener in a concise and approachable manner. From the heavy, chug burst-packed breakdowns to the frantic tremolo picking and the unending obsession with harmonic minor scale, everything about perfectly represents what I have come to expect from them. What's more, the harmonic minor scale is used in such a way that it creates the feeling that there is tension in the air, perfectly beffiting the theme of political rebllion tying together most of the album.
			</p>

				From a more traditional corekid standpoint, I feel obliged to discuss the breakdown. The breakdown is heavy by all standards, but considering it as a one-minute insrumental song with no buildup or makeshift callout: It's nothing short of a major achievement. Just under 2 decades later, even modern instrumental hits like Sparrow- as much of a hit as an instrumental metal song can be, that is- simply fail to transition so smoothly and coherently as Intro does.
			</p>
			<p>
				In other words, no song will ever match Intro in being objctively amazing and acheving everything and more it set out to: While being isntrumental and under a minute. Big claps for ABRB.
